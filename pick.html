<h1>Intro to circus skill's</h1>
<p> So you have decide to have a gander into the possible skill's and hobbie's you could learn for the circus sence, awesome! Underneath is a short overview of whats easiest to learn, a short display of the skill in question and an informal DIY guide for making your own</p>



<h2>STAFF</h2>
<p> Lets start with the staff. This hobby by far is the most practical and arguably the easiest, you can only have had a staff for one day and walk away having learnt "offical" tricks, moves, or stances however you like to refer to them.</P>

<p> Staff is a great place to start and relatively easy to make one DIY, "grip" or "spinning" staff is what ninty percent of people would have seen in movies, maybe at a festival or just a street preformance. "Dragon" or "contact" staffs are much more complicated to learn, however this does mean there is plenty of progression to be made when changing styles ;) </p>

<h2>DIY</h2>



<p> Making a DIY staff, the only real importance is that it is properly weight either end, i quite literally started with a broom pole with layers of duct tape applied to the ends and vayglue mesaered out, you can use any material for a grip in the center too as long as its evenly aplied.</P>

<h2>POI</h2>
<p> Poi, now these little thorns are medium diffcult, you could probably learn some "weaves" as there often refered to in again a single day. However unlike staff poi have strings that tie themselfs up, nott themself in your bag, and generally cause a nuesense. that being said Poi are simple beautiful, with little difficulty they produce a wide range of viuasl shapes to be apprecaeted and in my opinion are uncontested in terms of visual awe.</P>

<h2>DIY</h2>
<p>Making a DIY set of poi is very easy. I have used tennies balls in a pair of tights or rugby socks. This may seem a bit cheap but for getting started this is all you will need. you can also make a cross cut in a tennis ball and simply insert a thing rope.


<h2> JUGGLING</h2>
<p> Juggling is hard, unlike most other forms of circus activiteis juggling needs persaverance. To cement muscle memory for these annoying little devils takes time, this can be frustrating or discouraging, BUT WAIT! Once you have achieved the "three ball cascade" (what we call normal juggling that you will have seen) this skill is with you for life with so many tricks to learn. If you can put up with dropping them every 5 seconds for a day or so, then you will reap some rather cool braging rights</p>

<h2>DIY</h2>
<p>Making a set of DIY juggling balls, this one is so easy its funny literally any three objects of similar wieght will do. Also there is juggling scaffs that are very useful for getting started if you are struggling with the pace.</p>
